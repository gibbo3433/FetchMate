## USER STORY

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements

Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### CSS Styling

Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

* Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

* Try using a component library, such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

* Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose&mdash;it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

### Payment Platform

Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

### Description

Fetch Mate is a platform created with the idea of allowing dog lovers to find and connect with other dog lovers within their area or city. A user has the option to create a profile for themselves and for their beloved pet. When signing up the user has to enter their details as well as their pets. When another person clicks on the ones profile they are presented with the all of the owners details as well as what time they usually walk their pet, the dogs name, breed and age. Although the application concept is new and original the application UI is very easy to navigate and user friendly making sure that people across all age ranges are able to use it wihtout any problem. The application will have room for a lot of functionality improvements to further help and grow the community of pet lovers looking to socialise and look for a potential partner. Furthermore  create the application with the idea of being able to see other users and their profiles on a map which allows the users to pick and choose who they can connect with.
